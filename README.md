# Texas Product Community Hub

Texas Product Community Hub is a clearinghouse for community events in and around the Product space in Texas.

# Roadmap

Here's the approach this website may take:

- [x] Learn about other product camps and community product groups in Texas like in Houston and San Antonio.
- [x] Collect a list of active product groups and community enthusiasts
- [ ] Static Github Repo: List the things here to start feeding Google
- [ ] Share with Product Camp Austin network
- [ ] Add a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website to display this content
- [ ] Automation

# Overview

At the last [ProductCamp Austin](https://www.productcampaustin.org/), a bunch of hands shot up when asked what could be improved and how we could help. We learned of a lot of interest outside of Austin, and, in fact, a number of us had driven in from out of town to attend PCA. I heard of folks from San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, and College Station, and each of us described our more or less active product groups in our respective communities. The idea occurred to look for or create a [Texas community calendar of Product Events](https://www.productcampaustin.org/) to attend.

Being that people in Texas want to network, learn, and share more about product management and other product topics with colleagues either to enter the field or deepend within it, and having learned that that there are other product communities in Texas besides just Austin, the untested, unproven _hypothesis_ arose that having a product community hub in Texas to promote product events would be beneficial to the product community by increasing community participation in existing events, existing community events would see increased particpation, and individual satisfaction would increase. Using [the Jobs to be Done framework](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/jobs-to-be-done-framework/) and the assumption that "getting to product events" first involves knowing about them, we'll start small with collecting Product Camps and other product community events from Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. College Station should be on this list. See Roadmap for specifics. To contribute, [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pocketpm)!
